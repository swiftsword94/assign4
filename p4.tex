\\
The error for this input space separation is 0 because all of the inputs are correctly classified.\\
\section*{Question 5:}
\subsection*{a}
The minimum error that can be reached with a single perceptron for this classification task is 2, which means 2 points will be classified incorrectly no matter how much learning the perceptron does.\\
